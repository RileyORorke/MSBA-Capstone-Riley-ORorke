Week 1 - 1/25/2025

Progress: This week I received and combined all of the data from the client and have started work on the requested PowerBI dashboard.
Problems: Right off the bat I am running into some difficulties with my data, I was briefed by the client on the data that was sent to me; however now that I am looking into it more closely, it seems I am missing some cirtical information to create the dashboard at this time.
Plans: I have communicated my issues to the client, and I am working to schedule a weekly meeting with them so that we can discuss and examine the data more closely. I would like to have the dashboard portion of the project done by February 2nd so that I can begin working on the modeling portion of the project.
