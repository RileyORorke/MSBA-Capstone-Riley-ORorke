Weekly Posts - 3 P's

Week 1 - 1/25/2025

Progress: This week I received and combined all of the data from the client and have started work on the requested PowerBI dashboard.
Problems: Right off the bat I am running into some difficulties with my data, I was briefed by the client on the data that was sent to me; however now that I am looking into it more closely, it seems I am missing some cirtical information to create the dashboard at this time.
Plans: I have communicated my issues to the client, and I am working to schedule a weekly meeting with them so that we can discuss and examine the data more closely. I would like to have the dashboard portion of the project done by February 2nd so that I can begin working on the modeling portion of the project. 


Week 2 - 2/2/2025

Progress: This week I finished 99% of the dashboard for my client, it is just missing formatting details that I will fill in with the help of my client to suit their needs. I also worked with my client to request a secondary dataset to build the time series model from.
Problems: I had no major issues this week.
Plans: I plan to continue weekly communication with my client. Next weekend during our meeting I plan to finalize the dashboard for them and also receive and discuss the new dataset for the time series model. I also plan to begin coding work on the model next weekend.
